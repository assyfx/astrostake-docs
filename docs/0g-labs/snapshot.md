# Snapshot

While we provide snapshots for those who need them, they are not the primary method and are **used at your own risk.** For better security and reliability, syncing from scratch is always the best choice. Use snapshots only if you fully understand the risks.

### Snapshot Status

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Available

The snapshot is now available for download. Using the snapshot will significantly reduce sync time â€” depending on your system specifications, it may take around 1 to 2 hours to fully catch up to the latest block.

Without the snapshot, syncing from genesis can take 1 to 2 days or more.
