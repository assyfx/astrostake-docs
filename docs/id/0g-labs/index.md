## üõ°Ô∏è Validator

In the 0G network, Validators play a critical role in securing the network and participating in consensus. Validators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks, helping maintain the network‚Äôs integrity while earning rewards for their participation.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for:

- **Validator Installation:** Effortless setup with minimal commands ‚Äî get your validator up and running in minutes, including all required dependencies.
- **Wallet & Key Setup:** Creating/importing wallets and generating the required validator keys.
- **Validator Registration:** Instructions to register as an active validator on the OG Labs network.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Useful commands to monitor validator status and ensure optimal performance.

For a comprehensive walkthrough, visit the [Validator Setup Guide](./validator).

## üì¶ Storage Node

In the 0G network, Storage Nodes play a vital role in maintaining the system's decentralized storage layer. They are responsible for storing and serving data, ensuring data availability and reliability across the network. By running a Storage Node, you actively contribute to the network and earn rewards for your participation.

This guide offers step-by-step instructions for:

- **Installation:** One-click command install for both standard and turbo configurations.
- **Manual Setup:** Detailed manual installation process.
- **Snapshot Integration:** Instructions on integrating snapshots to expedite synchronization.
- **Useful Commands:** Commands for monitoring and managing the node.

For a comprehensive walkthrough, visit the [Storage Node Setup Guide](./storage-node).

## üßµ Snapshot Service

Snapshots provide pre-synced data to help new Storage Nodes sync quickly without starting from block 0. They are especially useful during testnet resets or fresh installations.

- **Snapshot Status:** Displays current snapshot availability and snapshot block.
- **Installation:** One-click commands or manual snapshot restore available.

Detailed instructions are available in the [Snapshot Guide](./snapshot).

## üß† Data Availability (DA) Node

DA Nodes are responsible for verifying, signing, and storing encoded blob data. They are essential for ensuring that data submitted on-chain is available and can be proven to exist.

This guide includes:

- **Requirements:** Hardware and staking prerequisites.
- **Installation Steps:** Comprehensive steps for installing necessary packages, setting up environments, and building the project.
- **Configuration:** Guidance on editing configuration files and setting up services.
- **Management:** Instructions for starting, stopping, and deleting the node.

Explore the full setup process in the [DA Node Setup Guide](./0gda-node).

## üõ∞Ô∏è DA Client

The 0G DA Client is a tool designed to interact with 0G DA Nodes by submitting, encoding, and storing blobs of data. It also enables data retrieval and availability verification through its built-in Retriever API. The client is typically run in a containerized environment and supports integration into blockchain validator stacks or other tooling.

- **Installation:** Uses Docker to run a custom-built image from source.
- **Environment Configuration:** Requires setup of private keys and DA encoder addresses.

Refer to the [DA Client Guide](./0gda-client) for more details.
