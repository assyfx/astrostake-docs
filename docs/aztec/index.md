# Aztec Overview

Aztec is a Layer 2 privacy protocol built on Ethereum that uses zk-rollups to enable secure and private transactions. It helps reduce gas costs while keeping transaction details confidential.

## Why Aztec?

- **Privacy-focused:** Keeps your transaction data hidden from others.
- **Gas-efficient:** Lower fees thanks to zk-rollup technology.
- **Secure:** Built on top of Ethereum's robust security.

## Aztec Node Guides on AstroStake

Currently, AstroStake provides a comprehensive guide to running an **Aztec Sequencer Node**, which plays a critical role in processing and ordering transactions on the network.

Sequencer nodes that meet certain criteria can be **upgraded to Validator nodes**, granting them additional responsibilities such as validating transactions and blocks to secure the network further.

More guides for other Aztec node types and upgrades may be added in the future.

## Get Started

### ⚙️ Aztec Sequencer Node

The Aztec Sequencer Node plays a vital role in ordering and processing transactions on the Aztec Layer 2 network. It ensures that transactions are sequenced correctly before they are validated and committed to the blockchain.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for:

- Sequencer Node Installation: Easy setup with detailed commands to get your sequencer node running quickly, including necessary dependencies.

- Configuration & Synchronization: Setting up configuration files and synchronizing the node with the Aztec network.

- Monitoring & Maintenance: Useful commands and tips to monitor the health and performance of your sequencer node to ensure smooth operation.

- Upgrading to Validator: Guidance on how sequencer nodes that meet certain criteria can upgrade to Validator nodes, taking on additional responsibilities such as block validation and network security.
